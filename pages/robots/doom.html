		<th>How we addressed the challenge:</th>
		<td>For Doom, we went with our tried and tested <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel">mecanum wheel system</a> that gave it extraordinary maneuverability. At the same time, using a new type of mecanum wheel along with our four wheel independent suspension, we allowed Doom to keep good traction with the ground. Our Frisbee shooting mechanism is a single-wheel-shooter slash linear-shooter hybrid, which works very similarly to a pitching machine that has been turned onto its side. Also, in order to make shooting from multiple locations a possibility, the turret holding the shooter can tilt up and down. In order to allow Doom to ascend to the first level of the pyramid without adding a secondary subsystem, the turret tilt had 250 foot pounds of torque in order to lift the entire robot onto the pyramid.</td>

		<th>Results:</th>
		<td>Doom had its successes and short comings. Most of its notable failures was self-inflicted destruction. Initially, Doomâ€™s shooter tilt moved with 750 foot pounds of torque. While this worked for some time, there were serious consequences when the shooter tilt stalled. It bent the metal holding the shooter into an unusable form. However, thanks to our awesome sponsor Bayless Engineering & Manufacturing, we had new metal parts laser cut and powder coated in a single day, so Doom was fully functional again by the next day, though with significantly less torque powering the shooter tilt. However, its capabilities really shone through with defense. At one point, it even pushed two robots at once, something normally unheard of for a robot with mecanum wheels. Doom was also capable of consistently scoring in autonomous mode. While Doom never made it into the playoffs, the 2013 build season was a season for team 691 and we learned a lot of new techniques that we look forward to using in the future.</td>

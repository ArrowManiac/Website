		<th>How we addressed the challenge:</th>
		<td>For our 2012 robot Mostly Harmless, team 691 continued to use our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel">mecanum wheel system</a> that we had developed the year before in order to maintain maneuverability. We also expanded upon our four wheel independent suspension by increasing the suspension travel. To lower the field's bridge, Mostly Harmless was built with an arm on the front that used the robot’s weight to push down the bridge rather than the strength of the motor itself. Also, Mostly Harmless had an extremely accurate target tracking system that used hand-coded image recognition software to locate and recognize the backboards of the basketball hoops. From there, it turned the shooter until the basketball hoops were centered in its cameras' views. Once centered, Mostly Harmless used the size and shape of the backboard to determine its distance from the hoop and whether or not it is positioned at an angle from the hoops. In order to process this information, a separate computer running Linux was put onto the robot. This computer then told the robot how fast to spin the shooter to make the shot. The shooter itself worked almost exactly like a baseball pitching machine.</td>

		<th>Results:</th>
		<td>Making Mostly Harmless was great for teaching our team how far we could go with programming in order to make operating the robot simpler. However, there were many difficulties. With this sharp increase in programming, we had trouble with the same 6-week deadline that is characteristic of FRC, so when the 6 weeks were up, our robot weighed 40 pounds more than was permitted. Consequently, we spent the entire first day of our first competition forcibly "dieting" the robot to make it lose weight. Also, Mostly Harmless was the first robot that we had ever attempted to operate swerve drive on. However, since the swerve system had not been perfected during build season, we had numerous problems with Mostly Harmless' drive system. However, with team 691’s perseverance and intelligent modular design techniques, Mostly Harmless was working with mecanum wheels by the second competition. With mecanum, we did well enough to be eighth place alliance captains in the competition.</td>
